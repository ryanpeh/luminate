# Luminate

Luminate is a Chrome extension that allows for downloading quizzes on LumiNUS, as printing the page does not properly print the contents of the page.

Currently it supports downloading the quiz to PDF and HTML file formats.

## Installation

You can install the latest version from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/luminate-luminus-quiz-dow/ocgahaldenhmlgenpapfekbpgbpgpajb).

## Instructions

1. Go to the Luminus quiz page that you would like to print.
1. Click the Luminate icon in the extension bar to display the popup user interface.
1. Click the download button to download the quiz in the desired file format.
